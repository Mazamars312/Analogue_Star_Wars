# Analogue Star Wars Arcade
This is the start of this core. Releasing it as im not able to complete it yet. This would be about 70% done.

The Sound and CPU boards have been done and tested working using the schematics of the oginal board. The vector board needs to be completed and working to output the video.

There is a lot to do to get these core working. here is the list
* Video core for the vector output - was trying to get SDRAM working on this at 720*720
* APF Uploader to the roms required
* Was testing this core with a MPU and Mame code to test how the AVG output worked and the scalling. 
* Controller input - Analogue controllers needed
* 

Releasing as is and this not a working core yet. You can put the Sound board into testing mode and hear all the audio output if you want.
